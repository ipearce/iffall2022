<h1 style="color:blue"> Introduction questions! </h1>
<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 1. </h2> <h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> Hello! I am Bella. I am a junior studying Communication Design and Human computer Interaction. </p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 2. </h2> 
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class. </h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> I took this class because I am really interested in how design and computer science can combine. Over the summer I worked for a space tech company doing graphic design for them but really wanted to delve deeper into the computer elements of design. I also taught myself Maya and Substance painter so I am looking forward to seeing if I can combine 3D elements into a 2D web program. </p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 3. </h2> 
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
<p style="color:dodgerblue"> I have taken CSE131 and I am currently taking Web Development this semester. I am comfortable around github and had experience with CSS in highschool</p>


<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 4. </h2> 
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> I hope to learn how to design and code in a workflow that fits well with what I want to create. I hope to be able to work with motion graphics on websites and build something I am proud of. Ideally feel comfortable around coding and creative coding.</p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 5. </h2> 
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> I think I will have to thing a lot more about how objjects are placed, and how elements will be affected when moving or changing screen size. We are taught in 2D about the flow of a book, but now we will have to think about the flow of a website and how that will shift and change with pages and devices.</p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 6. </h2>
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> https://thedieline.com/? </p>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> The die line exemplifies design because it is simple to navigate through yet has its own personality. The pacing feels fluid and the navigation is easy to find. </p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 7. </h2>
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue"> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> https://www.nytimes.com</p>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> The NYT provides effective communication through its mimicing of an actual newspaper. The black and white text with the same style font create a smooth transition between paper and the screen. Content is easy to find and bold titles clearly communicate headlines. </p>

<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue"> 8. </h2>
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue" > Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> https://wustl.instructure.com</p>
<p style="color:rgb(91, 137, 177)"> I chose canvas because while being a website it works as a fully digitized classroom and social networking space. Every class is organised in a similar structure so it can be found quickly. Over the pandemic it worked as its own digital university where classes could be held, homework, tests and discussions could be assigned and graded all in one space. </p>
