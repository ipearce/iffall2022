<p> I, I, when I was younger </p>
    <p>I, I, should have known better</p>
    <p> And I can't feel no remorse </p>
    <p> And you don't feel nothing back </p>
    <p>  I, I, got a new girlfriend </p>
    <p>  She feels like he's on top </p>
    <p> And I don't feel no remorse </p>
    <p> And you can't see past my blinders </p>
    <p> Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p> You've been on my mind girl since the flood</p>
    <p>  Oh, <em>Ophelia</em></p>
    <p>  Heaven help a fool who falls in love </p>
    <p>  I, I, got a little paycheck
    You got big plans and you gotta move </p>
    <p>   And I don't feel nothing at all </p>
    <p> And you can't feel nothing small </p>
    <p>  Honey, I love you, that's all she wrote </p>
    <p> Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p>   You've been on my mind girl like a drug </p>
    <p> Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p> Heaven help a fool who falls in love </p>
    <p> Oh,<em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p> You've been on my mind girl since the flood </p>
    <p>  Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p>  Heaven help a fool who falls in love </p>
    <p>  Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p> You've been on my mind girl like a drug </p>
    <p> Oh, <em>Ophelia</em> </p>
    <p> Heaven help a fool who falls in love</p>
