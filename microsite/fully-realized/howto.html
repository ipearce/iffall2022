<h2 > The Goal</h2>
<p> Hearthstone is a one-versus-one game where you must take the health of your opponent down from 30 to 0 in order to win. Attacking them directly with units on the board or spells will reduce their health, but some characters and cards can heal them back up. Each player takes a turn to draw a card from their deck into their hand, play any cards they wish and then attack the opponent directly or the minions they have on the board.</p></div>
<div class="howtocolumn">
<h2> Mana</h2>
<p> Each card you play costs mana, with you having a limited amount each turn, meaning you can't play all the best cards in the same turn. Your mana increases by one each turn up to 10, meaning the strongest cards cannot be played until the later rounds.</p></div>
<div class="howtocolumn">
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>As you progress in your abilities you'll head into the world of deck building, where you can select the cards you want to play with in each match. With thousands of cards to choose from and unlock you could be one amazing deck away from a run at the top level of play and it's discovering new strategies that makes Hearthstone’s deck building so fun.</p></div></div>
