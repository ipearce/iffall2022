      <h2> Hunter</h2>
      <img src="heros/hunter.webp" alt="knight">
      <p>According to Hunters, a ruthless offense of tooth and claw is better than any defense. These lone survivalists tap into their feral nature to take down their prey with hidden traps, tamed beasts, and volleys of baleful arrows.</p>

      <h2>Mage</h2>
      <img src="heros/mage.webp" alt="knight">
      <p>No other hero wields the arcane with as much skill and raw power as a Mage. Using their unrivaled array of spells, Mages can wipe entire boards of minions, deal devastating amounts of damage directly to their enemy, or summon creatures of pure energy to do their bidding.</p>
